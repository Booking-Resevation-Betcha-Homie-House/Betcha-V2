# Month/Year Filter Functionality for Top Rentals by Earnings

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a month and year filter functionality for the "Top Rentals by Earnings" section in the admin dashboard. This feature allows administrators to filter the rental properties chart data by specific months and years, with data automatically sorted by highest earnings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated HTML (dashboard.html)
- **Kept Existing Month/Year Dropdowns**: Utilized the existing month and year dropdown menus
- **Removed Sort Dropdown**: Eliminated the separate sort dropdown as requested
- **Maintained Responsive Layout**: Preserved the responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- **Added Custom CSS**: Included rotation animations for dropdown arrows

### 2. Enhanced JavaScript (dashboard-functions.js)
- **Simplified Global Variables**: Removed sort-specific variables, kept month/year filter tracking
- **API Integration**: Modified `fetchTopPropertiesData()` to send month/year parameters to the API
- **Dropdown Initialization**: Created comprehensive dropdown functionality:
  - `initializeMonthYearFilters()`: Main initialization function
  - `initializeMonthDropdown()`: Handles month selection with all 12 months + "All Months"
  - `initializeYearDropdown()`: Handles year selection with current year and previous 3 years + "All Years"

- **Automatic Sorting**: Implemented `sortPropertiesByEarnings()` that always sorts by highest earnings first
- **Filter Functions**: Added `setMonthFilter()` and `setYearFilter()` for programmatic control

## Features

### Filter Options
1. **Month Filter**: 
   - All Months (default)
   - January through December
   - Sends month parameter (01-12) to API

2. **Year Filter**:
   - All Years (default) 
   - Current year (2025) and previous 3 years (2024, 2023, 2022)
   - Sends year parameter to API

3. **Combined Filtering**: 
   - Apply both month and year filters simultaneously
   - API receives both parameters for precise filtering

### User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Dropdown arrows rotate when opened/closed
- **Current Selection**: Shows selected month/year in dropdown buttons
- **Automatic Data Refresh**: Chart updates immediately when filters change
- **Always Sorted**: Data is consistently sorted by highest earnings first
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all device sizes

### Technical Features
- **API Parameter Building**: Constructs URL parameters based on selected filters
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with fallback empty data
- **Performance**: Efficient API calls only when filters change
- **Clean URLs**: Parameters only added when filters are active (not "all")

## API Integration

### Endpoint Enhancement
The `fetchTopPropertiesData()` function now builds URLs with query parameters:

```javascript
// Examples of API calls based on filters:
// No filters: GET /dashboard/admin/rankProperty
// Month only: GET /dashboard/admin/rankProperty?month=08
// Year only: GET /dashboard/admin/rankProperty?year=2025  
// Both filters: GET /dashboard/admin/rankProperty?month=08&year=2025
```

### Expected API Response
The API should return filtered data in the same format:
```javascript
[
  {
    "propertyName": "Ocean View Villa",
    "totalEarnings": 15000
  },
  // ... more properties
]
```

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard
2. Locate the "Top Rentals by Earnings" section
3. Click the "Month" dropdown to filter by specific month (or select "All Months")
4. Click the "Year" dropdown to filter by specific year (or select "All Years")
5. Chart updates automatically with filtered data, sorted by highest earnings

### For Developers
```javascript
// Programmatically set filters
setMonthFilter('08'); // August
setYearFilter('2025'); // 2025
setMonthFilter('all'); // Clear month filter
setYearFilter('all');  // Clear year filter

// Access current filter state
console.log(currentMonthFilter); // Current month filter
console.log(currentYearFilter);  // Current year filter

// Refresh dashboard
refreshDashboard();
```

## Testing

### Test File
Updated test file (`sort-functionality-test.html`) demonstrates:
- Month filtering with all 12 months
- Year filtering with multiple years  
- Combined month/year filtering
- Sample data with different time periods
- Automatic sorting by highest earnings
- Responsive behavior and visual feedback

### Test Scenarios
1. **Month Filtering**: Select specific months to see filtered results
2. **Year Filtering**: Select specific years to see historical data
3. **Combined Filtering**: Apply both month and year filters together
4. **Clear Filters**: Select "All Months" or "All Years" to reset
5. **API Simulation**: Test with sample data showing different time periods

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting ES6+ features
- URLSearchParams API support
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Tailwind CSS compatibility
- Chart.js integration

## Future Enhancements
- Date range picker for custom period selection
- Quarterly and weekly filtering options
- Comparison between different time periods
- Export filtered data functionality
- Save user's preferred filter settings
- Real-time data updates

## Files Modified
1. `pages/admin/dashboard.html` - Removed sort dropdown, kept month/year filters
2. `dist/pages/admin/adminFunctions/dashboard-functions.js` - Added filter logic and API integration
3. `sort-functionality-test.html` - Updated test file for month/year filtering

The filter functionality is now fully operational and integrates seamlessly with the API to provide time-based filtering of rental earnings data, always sorted by highest earnings first.
